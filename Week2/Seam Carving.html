  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> 
The objective of this seam carving algorithm is to perform content aware
 resizing of images. This allows image to be resized without losing 
meaningful content from cropping or scaling. The idea is to locate the 
image's optimal seams, connected pixel paths going from top to bottom or
 left to right, to remove or insert while preserving the photorealism of
 the image. Furthermore, manipulating the gradient energy map that 
describes how optimal a seam is allows for functionality such as object 
removal. The technique described below is an implementation of the 
algorithm presented in <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~avidan/papers/imretFinal.pdf">(Avidan and Shamir)</a>.
 In addition, an improvement to seam removal is implemented using 
forward energy and the algorithm is extended to run on video based on <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~avidan/papers/vidret.pdf">(Avidan, Rubinstein, and Shamir)</a>. </p>

  <h2>Seam Removal Algorithm Overview</h2>The following steps describe seam removal, which is the basis for all the different functionality described later.
  <ol>
   <h4><li>Calculate energy map</li></h4>
<p>
   For each color channel, the energy is calculated by adding the 
absolute value of the gradient in the x direction to the absolute value 
of the gradient in the y direction. The energy for all color channels is
 summed into one 2D image to create the energy map.
</p>
   
   <h4><li>Find minimum seam from top to bottom edge</li></h4>
<p>
First, an accumulated cost matrix must be constructed by starting at the
 top edge and iterating through the rows of the energy map. The value of
 a pixel in the accumuluated cost matrix is equal to its corresponding 
pixel value in the energy map added to the minimum of its three top 
neighbors (top-left, top-center, and top-right) from the accumulated 
cost matrix. The value of the very top row (which obviously has no rows 
above it) of the accumulated cost matrix is equal to the energy map. 
Boundary conditions in this step are also taken into consideration. If a
 neighboring pixel is not available due to the left or right edge, it is
 simply not used in the minimum of top neighbors calculation.
</p>
<p>
The minimum seam is then calculated by backtracing from the bottom to 
the top edge. First, the minimum value pixel in the bottom row of the 
accumulated cost matrix is located. This is the bottom pixel of the 
minimum seam. The seam is then traced back up to the top row of the 
accumulated cost matrix by following. The minimum seam coordinates are 
recorded.
</p>
<p>This step is implemented with dynamic programming. An additional 
enhancement to this step that gives a more accurate energy value is 
described in the forward energy section.
</p>
   
   <h4><li>Remove minimum seam from top to bottom edge</li></h4>
<p>
The minimum seam coordinates from Step 2 are then used to remove the 
minimum seam. All the pixels in each row after the pixel to be removed 
are shifted over one column. Finally, the width of the image has been 
reduced by exactly one pixel.
</p>

   <h4><li>Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until desired number of seams are removed</li></h4>
<p>
This process is repeated until the desired number of minimum seams are 
removed. The energy map needs to be recomputed everytime a seam is 
removed. 
</p>

   <h4><li>Repeat Steps 1 - 4 for left to right edge</li></h4>
<p>
Steps 1-4 are originally describing reducing the image's width. The same
 code can easily be used for reducing the image's height by simply 
taking the transpose of the input image.
</p>
   
</ol>
<br>


<h2>Forward Energy</h2>
<p>
The forward energy enhancement is implemented by taking into account the
 energy created from the new neighbors after the seam is removed. The 
original algorithm is modified by adding this extra forward energy 
during the creation of the accumulated cost matrix. When deciding which 
top neighbor (top-left, top-center, top-right) in the accumulated cost 
matrix has the minimum energy value, the forward energy from the 
corresponding new neighbors is added to each top neighbor's accumulated 
cost value.
</p>
<p>
The benefits of forward energy usage can be seen below in how the angular shape of the mountains is preserved.

<h2>Seam Insertion</h2>
<p>
Seam insertion can be thought of as performing seam removal in reverse. If <i>n</i> seams are to be inserted, then seam removal must first be performed for <i>n</i>
 seams. The coordinates and order of these minimum seams is recorded 
during removal. The original image is not actually modified during this 
process, because the purpose is only to find the coordinates and order 
of the minimum seams. Finally, the coordinates are used to insert new 
seams to the original image in the same order that they were removed. 
The pixel values of the new seams are derived from an average of the 
top/bottom or left/right neighbors. 
</p>
<p>
Some examples of seam insertion are shown below.
</p>
<table border="2">
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>
<h4>Input (left) vs Resized (right)</h4>
<img src="Seam%20Carving_files/wyeth.jpg">

</td>

</td>

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
It is important to note that forward energy should <b>not</b> be used 
for seam insertion. This is because the forward energy from the new 
neighbors has no relevance to the expanded image. Actually, the original
 algorithm is sufficient for estimating the energy from the new 
neighbors in seam insertion, since the new seam is just an average. A 
comparison of the benefits of forward energy vs no forward energy in 
seam insertion is shown below. 50 pixels have been inserted to each 
dimension.
</p>

<tr>
<td>
<h4>Forward Energy (left) vs No Forward Energy (right)</h4>

</td>
</tr>

<br>

<h2>Object Removal</h2>
<p>
Object removal is implemented by first creating a binary mask during 
preprocessing of the object to be removed. First, the masked region's 
area is measured so it can decided whether it is more efficient to 
remove the object by removing top to bottom seams or left to right 
seams. Then, when generating the image's energy map, areas under the 
masked region are weighted with a very high negative value. This 
guarantees that the minimum seam will be routed through the masked 
region. Minimum seam removal is then performed as usual. The only 
difference is that when removing the minimum seam from an image, the 
same minimum seam must also be removed from the mask so that the next 
step's energy calculation is accurate. After the masked region has been 
completely removed, seam insertion is used to return the image back to 
it's original dimensions. Forward energy is used during the seam removal
 but not during the seam insertion.
</p>
<p>
An example of object removal is shown below.

<h2>Video</h2>
<p>Seam removal is also implemented in video by taking into 
consideration the dimension of time. The algorithm used is similar to 
that used for a 2D image, except it is being performed on a 3D block of 
video frames, with time as the z axis. The energy map used is actually a
 combination of the spatial and temporal energies. The spatial energy 
map is calculated by doing the energy map calculation described in the 
algorithm overview on all video frames and then finding the max at each 
pixel coordinate. The temporal energy map is calculated by taking the 
gradient between the frames (along the z axis) for each pixel. The 
spatial and temporal energies are then merged with a linear combination:</p>
<p>
<i>energy_map = (alpha)*spatial_energy + (1 - alpha)*temporal_energy</i>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, an <i>alpha</i> value of 0.5 would be the same as averaging the two energies together. An <i>alpha</i> value of 0.3 is used as suggested in <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~avidan/papers/vidret.pdf">(Avidan, Rubinstein, and Shamir)</a>.
 The reasoning behind weighting the temporal energy higher is that the 
human eye is more sensitive to motion artifacts. After the energy map is
 found, the minimum seam is calculated. Finally, the same minimum seam 
from all frames in the video are removed.
</p>
<p>
An example is shown below of the results of this algorithm on video. The
 resulting video has 100 pixels removed from the width of the original 
video.

<h2>Failure Case</h2>

<p>
This is clearly a failure case, because Larry Bird and Magic Johnson 
have become distorted instead of the background. This is probably 
because some areas of the players' skin and uniforms have lower energy 
than the crowd areas in the background. The gradient in these areas is 
relatively smoother than in the crowd. Also, the algorithm does a poor 
job of preserving the shape of their legs, especially where the legs are
 overlapping. A possible algorithm enhancement would be some way of 
telling that algorithm that these areas are important so that the crowd 
is removed instead.
